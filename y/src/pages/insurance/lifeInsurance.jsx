        <p>
          Life insurance is a financial contract or arrangement between an
          individual (the policyholder) and an insurance company. In this
          arrangement, the policyholder pays regular premiums to the insurance
          company, and in return, the insurance company provides a death benefit
          to the policyholder's designated beneficiaries upon the policyholder's
          death. Life insurance is designed to provide financial protection and
          support to the policyholder's loved ones or beneficiaries in the event
          of their passing. Types Of Life Insurance:

        <p>
          Life insurance is a kind of life insurance that offers protection for
          a predetermined number of months or years, or a term. In the tragic
          event that the insured passes away during the policy term, this sort
          of life insurance offers a financial benefit to the nominee. Low-cost
          term insurance products offer excellent life coverage. For e.g.: The
          cost of a $1 billion term insurance policy might be as low as $485*
          every month. These set premiums may be paid all at once, periodically,
          for the duration of the policy, or only temporarily. Depending on the
          type of premium payment method selected by the buyer, the premium
          amount varies. Term Insurance

          Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides coverage for
          a specific period (term), such as 10, 20, or 30 years. If the
          policyholder dies within the term, a predetermined amount is paid to
          their beneficiaries. Term insurance focuses solely on providing
          financial support in case of the policyholder's death.
