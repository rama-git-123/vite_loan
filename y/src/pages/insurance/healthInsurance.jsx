          </div>
          <p>
            Health insurance is a type of coverage that helps you manage the
            cost of medical expenses and healthcare services. When you have
            health insurance, the insurance company pays a part or the entire
            amount of your medical bills, depending on the terms of the policy.
            This financial protection ensures that you can access necessary
            medical treatments without having to bear the full financial burden.
            Health insurance plans can cover a range of healthcare services,
            including doctor visits, hospital stays, surgeries, medications, and
            preventive care, depending on the specific plan you choose.

              Types of Health Insurance:-
            </h4>
          </div>
          <p>
            <b>A. Indemnity Plan</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            An indemnity health insurance plan, also known as a fee-for-service
            plan, gives you the freedom to choose your healthcare providers and
            services. You pay for medical expenses upfront and then submit a
            claim to the insurance company for reimbursement based on the plan's
            coverage limits. This plan offers flexibility but requires managing
            paperwork and higher out-of-pocket costs.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>B. Fixed Benefit Plan</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            A fixed benefit health insurance plan provides specific pre-defined
            payouts for certain medical events, such as hospitalization,
            surgeries, or critical illnesses. The plan pays out a predetermined
            amount regardless of the actual medical expenses incurred. It offers
            simplicity and helps cover specific costs, but may not cover all
            healthcare expenses.
