          <p>
            General insurance is like a shield for things other than your health
            or life. It covers your car, home, travel, and more. If something
            bad happens, like an accident, theft, or damage, the insurance
            company helps you pay for the repairs or replacements. It's like
            having a backup plan for unexpected events that could cost you a lot
            of money.
