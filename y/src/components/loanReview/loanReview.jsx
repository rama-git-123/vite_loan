            During the COVID-19 times, I was in urgent need of some funds for
            the treatment of my brother and I was not able to get it from
            anywhere. Even the bank I have my salary account refused to provide
            me a personal loan, then my friend told me about RULOANS and after
            contacting them, I was able to get a personal loan in a span of
            three days from standard chartered bank.

            RULOANS helped me in getting a personal loan for my wedding. I was
            pretty impressed by the rate of interest, terms and conditions they
            got me by negotiating from the bank. I can surely refer all of my
            colleagues to RULOANS for applying any type of loan.

            I took a personal loan through RULOANS and used it to clear my
            credit card dues. This way I saved some money as the interest
            charged on my credit card was much higher than the personal loan.

            The comparison table, which RULOANS have provided on their website,
            is best. As it is very useful for every loan seeker. Using that
            table i applied with YES bank as it suited best to my requirements.
